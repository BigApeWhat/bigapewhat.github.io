## `Hello Worldz`
The first program any developer creates, it all starts with this one simple console output. Some IDE’s create it for you, they rob you of the joy in creating the first software you had to work for. If you were lucky enough you made a simple .txt file and ran it with a compiler to, that's real satisfaction. This is what you get from this website, hard work and satisfaction. It might not be coming from you personally, but your gonna feel the pain, just like the typo in the header. The worse part is that this is the homepage so you will see it every time you visit this site.

## `Why`
Not many sites have an intro, which is why I decided to make one. The main function of this site is to blog, consider this a “safe” place to learn, about Developer Encounters, Mobile, Server, and Software Architecture. This is in no way any special blog, although it is not your typical blog considering all the errors. There are no expectations by creating this blog, although this space will serve many functions, and it will give insights to all kinds of developers, or at least spark your brain. The information here should be perceived as insightful and encouraging to developers. I will be speaking my mind about workplace topics in which I believe many of us have been involved. This should encourage you that “the world is not after you” and “yea it happens” or “some companies are crap”. Be aware that I may have some topics that may be considered “offensive” or “controversial”, so if you like to make up drama and fight over the internet, this blog might actually fulfill your needs. 

Whats the point of living if you have to censor yourself.

## `So why blog?`
What would be a better way to show off knowledge and have a log of your professional skills and experiences? This is my documentation as as a developer, with a late start.

I have an internal mindset and need to improve my skill-set and reach out to areas I would not normally do. So a good amount of these blog will be experimental and some might not be a “how-to” guide but rather a first look or intro to a “what-is” X.

This will help me become a better developer by researching and articulated old and new information, just by the sheer fact that im doing research and investigating.

Share ideas and connect with people and the tech community. I am/was rarely involved but my interests have been growing and the best way to get involved is to be involved. With building a network, it is much easier get feedback on quality of my content, compare notes, and ensure that we are all heading in the right direction of moving forward.

Deliver useful content to help developers in their career, advance in their career, pave a path of becoming a “model” developer by providing new insights to problems they didn't know they have. 

Inform about common work place problems, types of work places, what to expect, or to compare if your job really sucks or its just normal day to day activity.

## `Got any qualifications dude?`
Well I don't have any real qualifications to be telling you whats what, but something brought you here. Either a search engine, or a hyperlink, social media post?, my business card, my job application… You must be interested in my work on some level, or I am in a some way appealing. Irregardless every dev has insights that another developer does not, so consider this an opportunity to learn. 

I am a big fan of Continuous Learning, call it a fan or not I just enjoy learning new stuff. I get bored doing the same thing over and over again, this is not limited to just hard work, but its also with shows, fitness, and even gaming. Repetition is boring so I consistently explore new topics and options to advance my career or expand my knowledge. Even with niche fields knowing very well that I will never be proficient in them, like electrical engineering, HDD recovery, video game development, crypto development, or my favorite astrophysics. Its part of the reason I have been evolved in many side projects.

## `Base standards`
1) Always use a CI pipeline with  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linter checks /.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security tools /.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality control tools /.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing gateway  
       
2) SOLID principles for solid devs  
3) 6 levels of testing (emphasis in decreasing order) – Unit, component, integration, api, ui, manual  
4) TDD – if it works for you, use it all the time, if it doesn't, learn the basics → it comes in handy  
5) Architectural patterns are needed for all services  
6) Separation of policy and detail (foundation and extensions)  
7) Intent documentation, swaggers, UML  
8) Remote is fine, except for team building activities, (sprint/PI) (grooming/planning)  
9) Agile software development  
10) Client driven  
11) Lunch & Learns / quality presentations of technology  
12) Hack-a-tons with beers and vodka

## `Eulogy`
May we give a moment of silence to all older technologies, paradigms, standards, languages, methods of building code or management that have brought us to the great advances in tech we have today. 

Callback hell and an endless inception of method calling is a thing of the past, at least for me. You should also take steps to ensure you will not get into any of these bad practices cause it will be your job in the Eulogy read next. 

Eclipse for Android development, oh how I use to praise you. One of the best IDE’s for android, well it was the only one for Android, so you were stuck with it. Then came along to the rescue “Android Studio” swinging its bat wildly with tons of fixes, ease of use and a friendly UI. It doesnt stop there cause Google started to support Kotlin, so Java died a little. With all that competition Oracle finally stepped it up and started to update its language with features most languages had to years, except for JavaScript which never gets updates. So for the Java vs Kotlin part it will be a long battle. I still use Java sometimes, although Eclipse got replaced with an IDE that works. 

Working overtime just to please the boss is never helpful. Think about it as if your getting friend zoned, the boss doesn't really care, they will use you up and spit you out when they are done. There will always be work to do and its not going to disappear. If your boss is consistently forcing you to work overtime to meet deadlines he promised, that's a different story. Short answer: Run away. Keep a healthy work life balance cause the biggest regrets are the memories you never made.

Promising commitments that you know you cannot complete is unprofessional, and should be avoided at all costs, except maybe at the expense of losing your job without a backup. If you know the work cannot be completed within the time frame, say something, give reasons why, and if no one listens or they make the commitment on your behalf, evaluate the outcome because you might have been over reacting else starting looking for a place that respects your professional input.

Waterfall model and Big Design Up Front are keys to failure. Just like humans, services are subject to change. You may think you know everything there is to know about how your service will work, and maybe you do, but maybe you will scrap parts, or some things don’t connect as you thought. Beware of not knowing how much you do not know. It very often and likely for a designer to change the design of a page, or sever to change an API call, or database admin to change the database schema. So why would you assume the needs of customers/stackholders will not. You want to iterate on the progress and leave it open for change. 

Micromanagement unfortunate is never going away on its own, its an instinct for someone to rub their professionalism all over your face. It is the single most annoying tactic I see in development and it does so much harm. You should prepare for it and find tactics against it, cause if you leave it alone it grows like cancer. Micromanagement is a BS tactic to make the person feel better that they are “smarter” than you and prevent you from developing the skills you need as a dev. The shame in doing something wrong, is perfectly fine, and you should learn how to take responsibility for your actions, its part of the job.

Bickering and fighting over which architecture/pattern/linter/format/characters per line etc… is never fun and some people are way to dedicated to a stance and can be stubborn as a mule. You should always keep your composure and have discussion with logic, reasoning, and knowledge but not emotion. When you debate with emotion you lose focus and attack them personally. Fight smart and know when to battle. 100 vs 125 characters per line is not worth breaking a friendship at work for. If its important get a third party involved to decide.

Who even makes introductions in blogs anymore. Its a blog, no one wants to read what they will read. Why even do it, only the lowest of the low would get as far as this and realize they are in an introduction but still cannot seem to find a way out. What are the last words of this author? The need to know is a powerful need. So kudos to the reader that follows through, now just do this with the programming task at hand.
