## Team Development
Forming teams in a company is a difficult task, much harder than it seems to be on paper. You cant just slap together a bunch of randoms together and expect great results. You also shouldn't expect to build a team once and never have to do it again for the life of the company. Unfortunately teams fight, argue, get off sync, cross platform confusion, communication difficulties, new member join while some leave the company, just so much crap. Im not going to talk in depth about these aspects, although they are important, like deciding to have cross platform teams or not. These are company specific and there is no better way of one way over another.Â

Teams less than 8 people seem to function and work together much more effortlessly. Too many people on a team causes ciaos, difficulties communicating and managing, so I am a big fan of smaller teams. Also having cross platform splits are great but its difficult deciding what belongs together since you have UI, UX, Android, iOS, Web, server, DB. I like to combine the ones that work heavily together and will be active all the time, I wouldn't want to pair Android and Server because Server will get ahead, so pair platforms by feature and work. 

An important rule for once you find the best team size and formation, don't change it too often. it is very important to keep teams the same, they build relationships, trust, and formality. It can take 6-8 months for a team to work well together, breaking them apart often will delay and restart the time it takes for the team to form. If it ain't broken don't change it. Teams that get alone have no reason to disband, if certain devs are wanted on other teams cause of their skills, find ways around it by either hiring, or getting someone else that wants to prove themselves in that field. Slowing down progress is almost always worse than hiring or training another dev.

Down to the dirty and gritty part, what ranks of devs work best together. In my experience, I personally prefer a mixture of various types. With a healthy mixture you get a Senior teaching the lower devs, and most likely they will comply since they are learning. There are sticking points, and a point in time when the Jr and Mid will start to fight back, but that's fine, its when restructure can start again. You may think that these teams move slower, but when you have a team of Seniors trying to micromanage and fight themselves all the time, that's when you will experience true slowdowns. JRs are so eager to learn that they do a lot without back talk just to see how it work, even if they think it is wrong. 

I noticed that all Senior teams tend to fight a lot, mostly about minuscule things but the arguments last a lifetime. It all comes down to how that dev learned what they know, and how open minded they are to other options. If you can make a team of all Seniors that are open minded and focus on the same goal, then of course that will beat any other team out there. I personally have never been able to see this, just like Bigfoot. There is always that one dev on a team that's stubborn and will never budge to new ideas. Sometimes its 2 Seniors that work well on separate teams, they discuss problems a lot with each other but cannot work together on a team. At a certain point they get all defensive about some things cause they care the product, and about their quality. Teams can also break apart because of internal heated conflict discussions, which causes a new problem. Having to find work or a new team for this dev.
