## `You want a piece of this tech?`
Learning a programming language from scratch is hard so expect that much, there are no good shortcuts. It takes a lot of work and requires some metal preparation to ensure that you do not quit when it seems impossible. There are so many programming languages out there, and each one seems to be a little different than the last. Not to forget they all exist for different reasons, while some exist for the same reason. Where to start… Assuming you have done some sort of research and you know what programmers do, we can get some basics down. These basics may guide you to a particular programming field just based on what interests you the most, but do not worry if it doesn't. Let me first tell you a little on how I got started, it will help you see some aspects. Don't get caught up on the languages I used, we will get into more detail later.
<!--more-->

## `How i got started`
I personally did know what I wanted to do, I wanted to be an Android developer, but I still started with 3 different programming languages that are not used in Android (languages were Visual basics, C, C++). Then I got a job in Unity development which I programmed in C# and JavaScript. Let me assure you that this did not waste my time. A lot of the patterns, structure and knowledge used in one language transfers to other. It may not be a direct one to one correlation but its close and its very useful to play around with a couple of languages. 

If by the end of this blog you still cannot choose a language just pick any language that is both, a modern language and in demand. Starting with any language is better than wasting time and deciding which one is the “one true language”, because your destiny may change at any time, but your knowledge will carry on. This way you will at least build a programming foundation, the arrangement of the house can still change.

## `Platforms`
There is only a handful Software Development platforms and if you can decide which one you see yourself in, it will drastically limit the direction you should go. I will not get too deep into what each one is but I will give a high level overview and popular languages to learn in each one.

### Desktop
This type of development requires you to create an application on a particular operating system such as Windows, Mac OS, or Unix/Linux. Each Operating System (OS) typically requires a different language especially if you want to do native development for that OS. If you work for Apple you wouldn't use a Microsoft language to develop applications. Although if your a third party company that wants compatibility with all OS's you might use a language that has parity in all the OS's.

**Windows** → C#, Java, Visual Basic, C++  
C# or Java would be my choices for starting off, and either one is fine cause they are very similar and easy to transfer knowledge. I feel like Visual Basic is a joke, and C++ may be too difficult, although both of these were my 2 first languages, and I don't use either of them. Which ever you choose be sure to at least try C++ because it is a very informative language and a “must try”, not necessarily a "must learn".

**Mac OS** →  Swift, Objective-C, Java, C++  
Swift is the language of any Apple products, and if you are an Apple fan this is your language. The previous language of Apple was Objective-C, and its still worth learning it, after learning Swift. A lot of applications in the Apple ecosystem will still use Objective-C, and you may find yourself in a job that has some legacy code in it.

**Unix/Linux** → C, C++, Python, Perl, Java  
Hands down C and C++ are so widely used in these systems. C++ is basically an extension of C, you will need to know both of these, but C is easier to learn. 

**Conclusion**  
Note that Java was in all 3 of these OS’s, which I would recommend if you do not have a specific OS you want to program in. Java has something called a “Java virtual machine” which allows it to be run in different OS, 1 program many systems. It has its ups and downs, some argue that you should program native to the environment to have the most performant and secure application. Either way this is a great start, a very widely used language, and one of the easier languages to learn when starting programming.

### Mobile
Developing applications for your handheld devices, and no I don't mean your PDA handheld. I'm talking about Android and iOS. Sorry Microsoft, but your Nokia phones are no longer wanted (FYI they had a Windows phone variant OS). Also considering that Blackberry gave up on their OS, its basically just these 2 that exist now.

Its weird how similar some things are in Android and iOS, its as if they are from the same company or they synced up, or copied each other. I may sound like im repeating myself but its the truth. 

**Android** – Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, C++  
True native Android development is done in either Kotlin or Java. Since Google is supporting Kotlin, learn that first, then Java. You need to know both, because many companies will still use or have legacy code in Java.

**iOS** – Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript, C++  
True native iOS development is done in either Swift or Objective-C. Apple is pushing for Swift development so learn that first, then Objective-C. You need to know both, cause many companies will still use or have legacy code in Objective-C.

**Conclusion**  
You may have noticed JavaScript, well you can also go on the route of creating a “React native” or “hybrid app” on mobile with JavaScript, these apps are usable across Android and iOS. Keep in mind that these ways are not as good as pure native development. There are lots of limitations on both of those approaches vs pure native, such as performance, customization, security, and memory management. Although it is getting better with "Flutter", but this is still just training wheels on your bike.

### Web
You are looking at the work of a web developer on this website and reading my text. This is what you would be doing, creating websites. Although you will not make websites like I did when creating this blog because this is a static site. There is just so much to know about web development so I will try to keep it short. 

2 languages JavaScript and Java. JavaScript is the language of web development, and there are tons of extended languages from it. Just learn JavaScript, after a while you will notice that you need to know HTML, and CSS, but don't worry about that now.

### Server
While Desktop, Mobile, and Web are all things the user can see, server is all the “behind the curtain” work where no user can see it. These platforms connect to the server to get data and populate it in a way that the user can acknowledge, like images or text. Not only do servers provide data, they also can create, update or delete the data and even perform heavy computations like AI analysis.

There are a couple of languages and I will also explain some stuff with this difficult platform. JavaScript, Ruby, ASP.net, Java, PHP. Its a heavily debatable list, and the problem with it is the scale of the server. Enterprise/large servers will most likely run with ASP.net, Java, PHP being the language, where smaller servers or micro-servers would use JavaScript or Ruby. I do not want to over whelm you with information on this topic cause it gets very deep. My top choice is JavaScript.

### Database
Mainly known as Query languages. This is a collection of data that is stored and saved, it would have data such as a collection of usernames and passwords for login, or list of all users personal information that has been provided during registration. Most typically these databases are something external from all other platforms, and provide its data to servers over the web. Although it is also common to have a local database on Mobile, web, or server and that data should not contain much personal information or if it does it would be encrypted. 

There are tons of different types of databases, and languages they use but the most common and worth learning first would be SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL. Its really mainly SQL driven so I wont list other possibilities.

### Systems
Programming the actual OS like Microsoft, Mac OS, Linux, Unix, iOS, Android. This is known as low level programming, since you are very close or even in the computers instruction architecture set, in other words your very close to machine code. I'm not gonna get into each system and their languages because the majority will be written in C and/or C++.

### Automation
This will involve writing code which tests the platform code to ensure that it will working as expected and these tests will be run regularly and automatically hence test automation. Or in other words, you are writing code that makes sure other code works within the constraints that were asked.

The programming languages for this job is so large because it involves knowing which platform you want to work on, and which testing tools will be used. For the sake of simplicity I am only taking in account the platform and in that case just look at my recommendations I put for each one above because chances are the tests will be in the same language but not guaranteed. 

## `Q&A`

**I just want to give programming a try, what are top languages to learn?**

My first choice would be Java or C# as my most recommended first languages. Either one is fine and which one you choice does not matter. Both of them are very similar and switching between them is easy. They are both widely used and a good introduction to programming in general, but that does not mean they are beginner languages as they have very advanced functionality.

My second choice would be C or C++, they have a more difficult learning curve but the challenge is worth the reward. With this high learning curve you will have a much easier time learning other languages if you learn these first.

I have no third choice but judging on the popularity being received, Python is making a huge impact, might be worth exploring. 
 
**Why are there so many languages?**

There will always be someone or a team of someones, that want to improve a particular aspect in programming by creating a new language, or build on top of an existing language. JavaScript is a good example, there are a bunch of “super sets“ such as TypeScript, JavaScript++, LatteJS, and OJ, you have 10’s of JavaScript Extensions. There is also a “lack of standards” and no restrictions on creating a new programming language, anyone can do it, it is up to the community to use and spread it. 

**Is it hard to switch languages?**

It depends, the main thing is that a lot of the knowledge will be transferred over but the new language can look like gibberish. It will take time to adjust and you will need to learn a lot. Some languages are easier to switch like Java to C# cause they are similar. Other can be hard cause they use very different expressions, like Haskell to PHP. If you notice that the languages have some or all programming paradigms in common then most likely it will be easier, but if they do not have any paradigms in common, most likely it will be a difficult switch. You wiki the language to see what paradigms it has.

**Im cheap and I don't wanna buy a book for something I may not like, where can I get free info?**

Benefits of the internet, you get free stuff. This is no exception, but remember you get what you pay for. Many of these languages offer tutorials straight from their website and this would be the best place to start, they will also inform you on how to get started on your machine. Also there is a lot of very valuable free internet resources, you can easily find it just by using your favorite search engine. There is a limit to the knowledge which you get for free but it gets you started and helps pave your path to success. This limit is also a good thing cause seeing the big picture can be discouraging. I do have ways to improve your skills once you develop a good basic understanding at the end of the Q&A.

**Im stuck and have problems understanding, what can I do?**

2 tips. 
1) Get a mentor (use google to find), this isnt an easy task but if you get one its extremely useful.
2) stackoverflow website is a community of coders that ask and answer questions about coding challenges they face and more. Most likely someone else had the same problem and already asked it, if not then you can ask.

**Best way to retain information?** 

This is solely on my personal experience and how I like to learn new things in tech. I like to learn the ins and outs of what is being done, and understand how and why it works before moving on. So learning a new library I would read documentation, try implementation, step through code to see what and how its doing it, and ensure I know why.

**I heard this was an easy job, why is this so hard, does it get easier?** 

Well yeah, your learning something new, its always hard from the start. You got to give it time to sink in and practice daily. I also noticed a couple of absurdly difficult step in the evolution of a programming career aka “great filters”. There are parts in programming that you just get extremely stuck on and have no idea what to do, even after hours of work. At these times a mentor would be great. If you cant get one then you gotta somehow find the answer online or just skip it, just be sure to note the issue you have so you can return to it in the future or ask someone at work.

**Im about to get interviewed, how do companies test my knowledge?**

Some companies may publicly inform how their recruitment process is setup, so look on their site.  

A typical pattern I notice with most companies is that they do 2 steps. First a technical knowledge check where they see how much you know about the language and platform you are applying for. Be sure to check online for common questions and try to expand and imagine what else they may ask on those topics. Secondly a written portion where they will ask you to actually write some code and solve some problem. Be sure you know how to debug, test, and run your service.

Other possibilities would be an actual written test, algorithms and data structures exercise, white board exercises. 

**Is school for fools or were my parents lying to me?**

Im a strong believer that self teaching is the best teaching especially in programming, this is a skill that you will use throughout your career. I also understand that not every can do this, at least not from the start, but it will be a skill you develop and hopefully perfect. 

Im going to be short with this, to which type of school should you do, tech or college. Doesn't matter, unless you go to a very prestige school, just make sure your school is good at what you want. Tech schools are cheaper quicker, and specialize in your field but no degree. Colleges don't rush material, you get more time with the teacher and you get a degree. In the end most companies care about what you know, although starting off it always looks better with a degree. I got one, and I feel like its not needed. I did learn a lot, which I might of not known that I needed until later if I haven't gone to school. Not knowing what you dont know is dangerous and school helps you see those things.

**I have already started programming, what can I do to improve my development skills?**

Do a bunch of programming challenges, exercises, and practices. Stick to quick and easy ones, the goal is to learn the language better and explore areas you are not familiar with, not to create a whole application.

Learn a new language even if its one you may never use.

Learn Algorithms and data structures and do online exercises

Learn programming patterns

Do you even test? Start writing tests, they are a pain but extremely important, quicker you get use to them the better.
