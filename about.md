## What am I

#### Specialization and most used Tech stacks
1. Android -> Kotlin, Java, Dagger, Retrofit, Coroutines
2. NodeJS -> Javascript, Express, Docker, Lodash, Async
3. Systems Architect -> Monolithic/Microservices/SOA, MVP/MVC/MVVM/CLEAN/DDD, UML

#### Outer scope deliveries
Uphold and enforce high quality coding standards, paradigms, patterns, and design. I am uptight about my code and encourage the team I work with to also keep strict guidelines. Im not saying my way is the best way, but they are consistent, readable, and understandable by all developers. Keeping the code clean is my topmost quality attribute in a system. It is what developers have to maintain and add to, and its the first thing new hires need to understand. 
 
A very important goal in projects is to have reusable architectural patterns. This is mainly for consumer based products but does apply to many other fields. When seeing and opportunity to create reusable components I evaluate effort, size of component, and reuse capability against cost. No one wants a component that wont be reused and took a lot of time and money to create. Same logic applies to systems such as SOA.

Minimal patterns within code base without restriction of developers mindset. Dependency inject, API calls, database connects, sockets, etc... These are a subset of patterns that should not require more than one pattern of creation. My worse fear is going into a project and seeing multiple ways of making an API call. This has no good rationale with excuses that every developer has a different style. 

Mentoring other developers. The best developers are the ones that are least stubborn and open to new ideas. I see this mentality mainly with up and coming developers. Senior developers are needed but too many on a single team with indirect direction cause too much conflict.

Agile but not too agile. I call it company first agile. While maintaining an MVP mindset, I tweak agile to improve performance within a company. This very's based on culture.
